# Fake-News-Detection
This project detects fake news articles using multiple machine learning classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. The workflow covers data cleaning, text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, model training, evaluation, and manual testing on custom inputs.


## Dataset

This project uses two datasets: `Fake.csv` and `True.csv`, which contain fake and real news articles respectively.

You can download them from Kaggle or other public sources and place them in the same directory as the Python script.
